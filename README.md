## Inter-subject correlation (ISC) for EEG data

This repository contains several functions for calculating inter-subject correlation for electroencephalography (EEG) data.
The algorithm was described in details in the next article
[Correlated Components of Ongoing EEG Point to Emotionally Laden Attention â€“ A Possible Marker of Engagement?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3353265/)

Testing data and functions for statistical comparisons will be added soon.
